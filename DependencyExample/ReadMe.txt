You can configure dependencies to other mods in mod.io.

The modio configuration ensures that all mods are installed. 

The local "gm.modcfg" makes sure that dll mods are loaded in correct order. 

You should only add dependencies to other dll mods in the config file. 

gm.modcfg should contain the mod.io IDs of all mods that need to be loaded into use before your mod.
